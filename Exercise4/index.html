            Cats are expert hunters and have a keen sense of smell, especially in the case of meat. 
            Not only will cats perk up at the sound and smell of a tuna can being opened, they will come running if they encounter the pungent opportunity to indulge in salami. 
            Is it okay to slip a slice of salami in with their kibble? 
            How about when they are swiping their tail across the floor and staring at you pleadingly while you eat your salami and crackers? 
            Surprisingly, cats are much better than other household pets when it comes to the heavy sodium and fat content of the cured sausage. 
            Your cat should be just fine with a couple pieces of salami as a treat.
